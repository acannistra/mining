# Q: How are mines geospatially and demographically distributed?
Tony Cannistra

Motivating question: We fight against extractive industries in special places, but where do they go when weÂ win?

## Data
The United States Geological Survey's Mineral Resources Data System ([MRDS](https://mrdata.usgs.gov/mrds/))was the source of much of the mines data. You can download the copy that I used [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/p818zimuh04bfkw/AACLavUCYTyLrWxjRc6iK2GMa?dl=0) (~900MB). 

For the ecological analyses I utilized WWF ecoregions, which you can get [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cri3f31mo1tbrkv/AAD_vot3eGAHiQvKzMcITI1sa?dl=0) as a shapefile. 

Data for the economic analysis comes from the [WorldBank](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD).
